 Hey Matush, how are you? Hi, Oksha. I'm very good. I feel very productive because we found and time at Friday at 7 p.m. to work. So I'm very happy and very motivated. I'm glad that you're happy because this is a good project and we can learn a lot from it. Yes. And we have accomplished what today because we had straight go to run your Python script with Docker. I think we did it, but one thing is not finished that we somehow cannot write to file. We cannot create a file because of I guess, I guess, permission problems, but otherwise the thing is working. It's at least it's printing the text. Well, it's a video. So I think we are successful today. Yeah, that's cool. High degree. So let's try and test the script and our Docker application one more time with this new recording. You agree? Yes. Absolutely. Cool.
