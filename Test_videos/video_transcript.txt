 Hey Matos, how are you? Hi Alesha, I'm very good, I feel very productive because we found a time at Friday at 7pm to work so I'm very happy and very motivated. Me too, I'm glad that you're happy because this is a good project and we can learn a lot from it. Yes, and we have accomplished a lot today because we had a straight goal to run your Python script with Docker. I think we did it, but one thing is not finished, that we somehow cannot write the file, we cannot create the file because of permission problems, but otherwise I think it's working. At least it's printing the text, what is in the video, so I think we are successful today. Yeah, that's cool, I agree. So let's try and test the script and our Docker application one more time with this new recording. You agree? Yes, absolutely. Cool.
